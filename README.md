# Data-Engineering - Sales Data Collection and Analysis

## Introduction

The objective of this project report is to showcase the process of sales data collection and analysis using a sample dataset available on MongoDB. This project focuses on utilizing R code within the RStudio environment, incorporating essential packages to accomplish various tasks and achieve meaningful insights. 

The project encompasses the following essential components:

- **Data Wrangling**: This initial step involves loading the dataset and employing the tibble structure to ensure efficient data handling. Additionally, it includes addressing missing data by implementing appropriate techniques to ensure data completeness and accuracy.

- **Data Transformation**: This component involves the removal of unnecessary columns from the dataset to speed up the analysis. By filtering the data based on specific criteria, we can focus on the relevant information required for the objective of analysis.

- **Data Analysis**: The key component of this project, data analysis involves utilizing different visualizations to learn more about the sales data. We will produce bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to identify trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset. These visual representations will aid in understanding the distribution of sales, identifying key factors influencing sales performance, and exploring potential correlations between variables.

- **Data Modelling**: An integral part of the project, data modelling will apply supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. These models will facilitate prediction and classification tasks based on the available sales data. By leveraging these models, we can gain further insights into underlying patterns and make informed decisions based on the findings.

- **Data Communication**: Effective data communication is essential to convey the results and conclusions derived from the analysis. The project report will highlight key findings, interpretations, and recommendations in a clear and concise manner, providing a comprehensive overview of the sales data and the significance of the analysis.

The persuasiveness of the project report will be a crucial factor in the evaluation process. It is vital to present the data compellingly by demonstrating a thorough understanding of the data, the applied methodologies, and the implications for decision-making.
